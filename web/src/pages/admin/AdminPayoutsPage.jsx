 * The payout queue.

 * Tabbed by status, like the applications screen, and for the same reason: the
 * columns a settled payout needs are the columns a waiting one needs, so a
 * second screen would have been this screen with a different title.
 *
 * There is no refuse action. An admin who does not intend to pay a request
 * leaves it in "Waiting" - nothing here forces a decision, and a request that
 * should not be paid is a conversation to have with the organiser rather than a
 * button.
 *
 * The tab that matters most is APPROVED, and it is the one a queue would
 * normally not have. It holds money the platform has agreed to send and has not
 * sent - a state that is nobody's problem until somebody looks, which is
 * precisely why it gets a tab of its own rather than being folded into "done".

 * How the payable figure was arrived at, in one tiny line under it.

 * version printed bare amounts joined by a dash - "$0.60 − $0.06 (10%)" - which
 * reads just as naturally as a range, or as something being clawed back, as it
 * does as a commission.
